# Rogges-Ant
A cellular automata with similar rules to Langton's Ant but different behavior
## Usage Note:
mapMaker.py takes a filename as a command-line argument which is where it will save to. To test this out, try
```
python mapMaker.py ./antMaps/ulam.txt
```
click anywhere on the canvas to play/pause the simulation
gridAutomata.py also takes a filename as a command-line argument, which is where it reads a map from. Try
```
python gridAutomata.py ./antMaps/ulam.txt
```
click squares to flip their direction
